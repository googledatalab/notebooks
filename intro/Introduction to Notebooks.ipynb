This capability allows you to issue command-like instructions or use alternate languages in the same notebook. These code cells start with an escape sequence, `%%`, which instructs the session to treat the content of the cell as something other than Python. If you're familiar with IPython notebooks, you might have come across the term `cell magic`. Here's an example of a bash cell that lets you invoke a shell command."
