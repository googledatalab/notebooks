    "# SQL Query Composition\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook builds on previous notebooks that illustrate relatively simple SQL queries (queries with a single `SELECT` statement to retrieve and analyze BigQuery data). This notebooks illustrates how Google BigQuery allows you to use nested queries to create complex queries that successively filter or slice/dice results or perform joins in a single query issued to the service. Constructing these complex queries can often be made easier when done step-by-step.\n",

    "Although query composition through step-by-step building is intrinsically iterative, this notebook solution represents a snapshot of the final state. For illustrarive purposes, each step of the iteration is broken out into separate sections, but it's unlikely you'll do the same in a real-task scenario."
