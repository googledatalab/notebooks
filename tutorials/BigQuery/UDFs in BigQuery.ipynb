They are temporary, and live only within the query that uses them.\n",

    "\n",
    "UDFs are functions written in one of the supported languages (currently SQL and Javascript), that take a column and produces a value for each value in that column, after performing some computation. The BigQuery UDF documentation explains that the `CREATE TEMP FUNCTION` call is needed to define a UDF, including its parameter names and types, return type, and language. Datalab simplifies this syntax; it makes use of jsdoc-style `// @param` comments to achieve the same result. Also, it exposes UDFs as a Python class, and a magic command, to make building queries simpler. Let's see how we can do this:"
